    Recursive Data Structures in Python
    A data structure is recursive if it can be deÔ¨Åned 
    in terms of a smaller version of itself. 
    
    A list is an example of a recursive data structure. 
    Let me demonstrate. 
    Assume that you have only an empty list at your disposal, 
    and the only operation you can perform on it is this:
