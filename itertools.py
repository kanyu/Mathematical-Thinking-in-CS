If you print out makes_100, you will notice there are 
a lot of repeated combinations. This makes sense because 
you can make change for $100 with three $20 dollar bills and four $10 bills, 
but combinations() does this with the first four $10 dollars bills 
in your wallet; the first, third, fourth and fifth $10 dollar bills; 
the first, second, fourth and fifth $10 bills; and so on.
To remove duplicates from makes_100, you can convert it to a set:
>>> set(makes_100)
{(20, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
